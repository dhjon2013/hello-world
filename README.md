To Whom It May Concern:

My name is Delores Jones.  
As a freelancer performing web development duties, I build and maintain websites.  Though my duties tend to vary based upon the project, I present your clients' products and services to a wide audience by creating attractive, functional websites. I identify potential site users and design a website that appealed to the clients.  I, also, meet with clients via email or phone contact regarding his or her desires for a website or discuss how to keep their website functioning and up to date. In some cases, I construct the layout of a website, create a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design, as well as write the content for the website.
